Hi Mum! Said Dad

Technical Interview

This technical test is for HMSD to understand your process, coding ability and
approach to solving a problem using the tools available to a dotnet developer.
Please review this technical test and let the original sender know when you will be
able to complete it. We know appreciate everyone has busy lives so we donâ€™t want to
tell you when you need to fit this in. However, we do speak to a number of
candidates and the sooner you can complete this the better. Please send your full
source-code and any handover notes you wish to share to the original sender

We expect this test should take you roughly 3-4 hours to complete and any code
must be your own work unless explicitly noted within the source-code.
